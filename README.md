*Often times, data scientists and researchers are biased to advanced machine learning models because of their predictive power. Here, we compared logstic regression with two boosting algorithms and explained why boosting alrithms perform better than logistic regression.*

*This project develops a logistic regression model to predict __loan approval probabilities__ for Indian loan applicants. Model performance is evaluated using __accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC__, while __Population Stability Index (PSI)__ is applied to assess model stability across training and test datasets. The analysis highlights how credit score, loan term, and loan-to-income ratio influence loan approval likelihood.*
