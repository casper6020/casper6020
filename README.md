## Biography
Hello! I'm Syed As-Sadeq Tahfim, and I graduated with a PhD in Management Science and Engineering from Dalian Maritime University, China. In addition to being a researcher, I am an aspiring data scientist. I am an expert in exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis (e.g., regression analysis), and machine learning models (e.g., decision tree, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, feed-forward neural network, recurrent neural network, and long short-term memory neural network). I can create Dashboard web applications using Streamlit. Currently, I am working on developing a credit scorecard model for nano and micro-loans for individuals and MSMEs. I have published one SCI/SSCI-indexed and two EI-indexed research articles on factors affecting the severity of crashes involving large trucks.
